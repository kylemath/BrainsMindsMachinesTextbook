    <p class="lead">Your senses flood your brain with far more information than you can consciously process. Every second, millions of photons hit your retinas, thousands of sound pressure waves reach your ears, hundreds of odorant molecules bind to nasal receptors. Yet your conscious experience is selective, focused, and coherent. This is attention—the brain's solution to information overload. Today we'll discover how attention acts as both spotlight and filter, amplifying relevant signals while suppressing distractions.</p>

    <h2 id="cocktail-party">Opening: The Cocktail Party Problem</h2>

    <p>You're at a crowded party. Dozens of conversations surround you. Yet somehow you can focus on the single voice of the person in front of you. Then someone across the room says your name, and your attention immediately shifts—you heard your name despite not consciously attending to that conversation. This is the cocktail party effect, first described by Colin Cherry in 1953.</p>

    <p>Michael Posner's framework divides attention into three networks: the <strong>alerting network</strong> maintains vigilance, the <strong>orienting network</strong> directs attention to specific locations (the spotlight), and the <strong>executive control network</strong> resolves conflicts between competing inputs.</p>

    <p>Attention comes in two flavors: <strong>exogenous (bottom-up)</strong>—automatic, stimulus-driven—and <strong>endogenous (top-down)</strong>—voluntary, goal-driven.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="neural-mechanisms">Neural Mechanisms of Attention</h2>

    <h3 id="gain-modulation">Gain Modulation: Turning Up the Volume</h3>

    <p>The dominant mechanism is gain modulation—attention multiplies neural responses by a constant factor. When you attend to a location, neurons with receptive fields there increase their firing rates by 20-50%, even before the stimulus appears. This is anticipatory modulation.</p>

    <h3 id="biased-competition">Competition and Biased Competition</h3>

    <p>The biased competition model proposes that multiple stimuli within a neuron's receptive field compete for neural representation. Attention resolves this competition by biasing responses toward the attended object. Attention doesn't just enhance attended stimuli; it also suppresses unattended stimuli.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="audition">Audition: The Frequency Analyzer</h2>

    <h3 id="air-to-neural">From Air Pressure to Neural Code</h3>

    <p>The auditory system performs a Fourier transform mechanically, before any neural processing. Sound creates a traveling wave along the basilar membrane. The membrane is narrow and stiff at the base and wide and flexible at the apex. High frequencies cause maximum displacement near the base; low frequencies near the apex. This is tonotopy.</p>

    <h3 id="hair-cells">Hair Cells: Mechanotransduction at Microsecond Resolution</h3>

    <p>Ion channels open in less than 10 microseconds after stereocilia deflection. This is orders of magnitude faster than any G-protein cascade—it must be, to encode sounds up to 20,000 Hz. The mechanism is purely mechanical.</p>

    <h3 id="auditory-pathways">Central Auditory Pathways: Building Sound Perception</h3>

    <p>Sound localization uses two cues: <strong>interaural time differences (ITDs)</strong> and <strong>interaural level differences (ILDs)</strong>. Neurons in the medial superior olive act as coincidence detectors for ITDs, creating a map of azimuthal sound location.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="olfaction">Olfaction: The Ancient Sense</h2>

    <h3 id="chemical-detection">Chemical Detection Without a Map</h3>

    <p>Each olfactory receptor neuron expresses one type of receptor from approximately 400 genes. The coding strategy is combinatorial. A rose's scent activates a specific pattern across the 400 receptor types; a lemon's scent activates a different pattern.</p>

    <h3 id="direct-route">Direct Route to Cortex and Limbic System</h3>

    <p>Olfaction is the only sensory system that bypasses the thalamus. ORNs project directly to primary olfactory cortex and to the amygdala and entorhinal cortex. This explains why smells so powerfully evoke emotions and memories—the Proust effect.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="gustation">Gustation: Five Basic Tastes</h2>

    <h3 id="taste-transduction">Taste Transduction: Five Receptors, Five Qualities</h3>

    <p>Taste detects five basic qualities: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. These reflect fundamental nutritional and toxicological significance. Sweet detects sugars (energy), umami detects amino acids (protein), bitter detects alkaloids (toxins).</p>

    <h3 id="flavor">Flavor as Multisensory Integration</h3>

    <p>What you call "taste" is actually flavor—a multisensory construction combining taste, smell, touch, and even sound. When you have a cold, food has no "taste" because you've lost retronasal olfaction.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="universal-principles">Universal Principles</h2>

    <h3 id="receptive-fields">Receptive Fields Across Modalities</h3>

    <p>Every sensory neuron has a receptive field—the region of sensory space where stimuli can influence that neuron's activity. For a somatosensory neuron, it's a patch of skin. For a retinal ganglion cell, it's a region of visual space. For an auditory neuron, it's a range of frequencies.</p>

    <h3 id="population-coding">Population Coding: Ensembles Over Individuals</h3>

    <p>Perception depends not on single neurons but on populations. The brain uses population coding—information is distributed across many neurons with overlapping tuning curves. The advantage is robustness: if a few neurons die or fire noisily, the population response remains stable.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2 id="synthesis">Synthesis: The Architecture of Sensation</h2>

    <p>Despite different stimulus spaces and transduction mechanisms, all sensory modalities share fundamental computational principles: receptive fields, tuning curves, population coding. All project to cortex where learning refines representations. All interface with attention systems that select relevant information.</p>

    <p>The universal finding is that sensation is active construction, not passive reception. At every level—receptor, brainstem, thalamus, cortex—neurons transform input, extracting features, enhancing contrast, suppressing redundancy. What you experience as immediate and direct is actually the end product of massive parallel computation.</p>
